Get a list of all your gists! It makes getting a lists of your gists pure bliss.

Seriously though, I wanted a code snippet tool that was completely editor agnostic so I would never have to worry about not having access to them.
This also has the benefit of living in your menu tray for ease of access at all times.

Just press Cmd+Shift+Spacebar (Mac OSX) or Cntrl+Shift+Spacebar (Windows, Linux) to bring up your code snippets.
If you haven't guessed yet, code snippets are powered by [gists](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/).
